"""Transaction cost models.

Costs apply to turnover (notional traded). For a long/flat strategy with
unit-leverage positions in {0, 1}, the turnover per bar is the absolute
change in position, and the cost is::

    cost_t = |position_t - position_{t-1}| * (bps / 10_000)

This is subtracted from gross returns to produce net returns.
